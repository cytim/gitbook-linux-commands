# Git: Setup New Project


### From Existing Git Project

1. Go to the directory which will hold the project directory.

    ```sh
    # for example
    cd ~/projects
    ```

1. Clone the project.

    > You might need to [setup SSH](/miscellaneous/ssh.md) if you clone the project by SSH.

    ```sh
    git clone <endpoint> [DIR_NAME]
    ```
